#hmt-utils#


Utility library for editorial work specific to the standards of the Homer Multitext project.

This should incorporate and replace HMT-specific material previously developed as part of generic
CITE architecture libraries, such as hocuspocus, or generically HMT functions developed in specific apps
like HMT-MOM.

It should certainly include:

- HmtGreekTokenization
- HmtTokenizer
- HmtDefs
