#hmt-utils#


Utility library for editorial work specific to the standards of the Homer Multitext project.

Current development focuses on refactoring the validating library to facilitate switching over to use the  [Kanōnes](http://neelsmith.github.io/greeklang/morphology/) system for morphological parsing.  In the `0.9.x` series, lexical validation is turned off.  When validating with Kanōnes is supported, we will release a `1.0` version.

The project web page at <http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-utils/> will be updated when a 1.0 release is complete.
